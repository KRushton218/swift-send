# Logging Summary - Deletion Operations

## What Was Added

Comprehensive logging has been added throughout the entire deletion flow to help you debug and monitor deletion operations in real-time.

## Files Modified

### 1. MessagingManager.swift
- ✅ `deleteMessageForUser()` - Full deletion flow logging
- ✅ `hideConversationForUser()` - Conversation hide logging
- ✅ `observeActiveMessages()` - Real-time message observer logging
- ✅ `loadOlderMessages()` - Historical message loading logging

### 2. FirestoreManager.swift
- ✅ `deleteMessageForUser()` - Firestore update logging

### 3. ChatViewModel.swift
- ✅ `deleteMessage()` - User action logging

### 4. MainViewModel.swift
- ✅ `deleteConversation()` - Conversation hide action logging
- ✅ `filterConversations()` - Filtering logic logging

### 5. Models.swift
- ✅ `isDeletedForUser()` - Deletion check logging

## Log Categories

### 🗑️ Message Deletion
Tracks the complete flow from user action to database updates to UI refresh.

### 👻 Conversation Hiding
Tracks conversation hide operations and filtering.

### 📨 Real-time Observation
Tracks how messages are added, changed, and removed in real-time.

### 📚 Historical Loading
Tracks loading older messages from Firestore and filtering deleted ones.

### 🚫 Filtering
Shows when messages/conversations are filtered out due to deletion.

## How to Use

### Quick Test
1. Open Xcode console (`Cmd + Shift + Y`)
2. Clear console
3. Delete a message or conversation
4. Watch the logs flow through each step

### Filter by Operation
In Xcode console search bar, type:
- `[DELETE]` - See only message deletion logs
- `[HIDE]` - See only conversation hide logs
- `[OBSERVE]` - See only real-time observer logs
- `❌` - See only errors

### Expected Flow for Message Deletion
```
🗑️ [ChatViewModel] User requested message deletion
🗑️ [DELETE] Starting message deletion
📝 [DELETE] Updating Firestore...
✅ [DELETE] Firestore updated successfully
📝 [DELETE] Updating RTDB...
✅ [DELETE] RTDB updated successfully
🎉 [DELETE] Message deletion complete!
🗑️ [OBSERVE] Message deleted, removing from local cache
📤 [OBSERVE] Emitting updated message list
✅ [ChatViewModel] Message deletion completed
```

### Expected Flow for Conversation Hiding
```
👻 [MainViewModel] User requested conversation hide
👻 [HIDE] Starting conversation hide
✅ [HIDE] Conversation hidden successfully
🎉 [HIDE] Conversation hide complete!
✅ [MainViewModel] Conversation hide completed
🔍 Filtering conversations
👻 [MainViewModel] Filtering out hidden conversation
📊 [MainViewModel] Conversation count: X → Y
```

## Troubleshooting

### If message doesn't disappear:
1. Look for `❌ [DELETE]` errors
2. Check if RTDB update succeeded
3. Verify observer received the change (`🗑️ [OBSERVE]`)

### If conversation doesn't hide:
1. Look for `❌ [HIDE]` errors
2. Check if filtering was triggered (`🔍 Filtering`)
3. Verify conversation count decreased (`📊`)

### If deleted items come back:
1. Check Firestore update succeeded (`✅ [FirestoreManager]`)
2. Verify deletedFor array is populated
3. Check filtering on load (`🚫 [LOAD]`)

## Performance Note

These logs are verbose and intended for debugging. For production:
- Consider wrapping in `#if DEBUG` blocks
- Or use OSLog with appropriate log levels
- Keep error logs but reduce verbose info logs

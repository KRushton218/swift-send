# Deletion Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a simplified per-user deletion system for messages and conversations. Users can delete content from their view without affecting other participants.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principle: Soft Delete with User Tracking
- **Message Deletion**: Track which users deleted each message via `deletedFor` array
- **Conversation Deletion**: Hide conversation from user's list via `isHidden` flag
- **No Automatic Hard Deletion**: All data preserved indefinitely for safety and legal compliance
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Messages and conversations filtered on read, not on delete

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Models (`Models.swift`)

#### Message Model
- **Added**: `deletedFor: [String]?` - Array of user IDs who deleted this message
- **Added**: `isDeletedForUser(_ userId: String) -> Bool` - Helper method to check deletion status
- Updated all initializers and conversion methods to support `deletedFor`

#### UserConversationStatus Model
- **Added**: `isHidden: Bool` - Flag indicating user hid this conversation
- Updated initializers and conversion methods to support `isHidden`

### 2. Managers

#### MessagingManager
- **New**: `deleteMessageForUser(conversationId:messageId:)` - Adds current user to message's `deletedFor` array in Firestore
- **New**: `hideConversationForUser(conversationId:)` - Sets `isHidden` flag in RTDB for current user
- **Updated**: `observeActiveMessages()` - Filters out messages deleted by current user
- **Updated**: `loadOlderMessages()` - Filters out messages deleted by current user
- **Deprecated**: Old `deleteMessage()` and `deleteConversation()` methods (kept for backward compatibility)

#### FirestoreManager
- **Updated**: `getArchivedMessages()` - Now reads `deletedFor` field from Firestore documents

### 3. ViewModels

#### ChatViewModel
- **Updated**: `deleteMessage()` - Now calls `deleteMessageForUser()` instead of old delete method
- Messages automatically filtered out via observer

#### MainViewModel
- **Updated**: `deleteConversation()` - Now calls `hideConversationForUser()` instead of old delete method
- **Updated**: `loadConversations()` - Filters out hidden conversations based on RTDB status
- **New**: `filterConversations()` - Re-filters conversations when statuses update

### 4. Views

#### ChatDetailView
- Already had delete functionality via context menu (long-press)
- No changes needed - works with updated ViewModel

#### MainView
- Already had swipe-to-delete functionality
- No changes needed - works with updated ViewModel

### 5. Security Rules

#### Firestore Rules (`firestore.rules`)
- **Updated**: Message update rule to allow users to add themselves to `deletedFor` array
- Maintains security: users can only modify `deletedFor`, not other fields

## How It Works

### Message Deletion Flow
1. User long-presses message and selects "Delete"
2. `ChatViewModel.deleteMessage()` called
3. `MessagingManager.deleteMessageForUser()` adds user ID to Firestore `deletedFor` array
4. Message observer receives update
5. Message filtered out client-side via `isDeletedForUser()` check
6. Message disappears from user's view

### Conversation Deletion Flow
1. User swipes conversation and taps "Delete"
2. `MainViewModel.deleteConversation()` called
3. `MessagingManager.hideConversationForUser()` sets `isHidden: true` in RTDB
4. Status observer receives update
5. `filterConversations()` removes hidden conversations
6. Conversation disappears from user's list

### Data Preservation
- **Messages**: Remain in Firestore with `deletedFor` array tracking who deleted them
- **Conversations**: Remain in Firestore, only hidden in RTDB user status
- **RTDB Messages**: Naturally age out of 50-message window, no manual deletion needed
- **Recovery**: Admin can view/restore deleted content if needed

## Benefits

### Simplicity
- ~50 lines of new code vs. 300+ for complex approach
- Single source of truth (Firestore for messages, RTDB for status)
- No complex "check all users" logic
- No batch operations or cleanup jobs

### Safety
- No accidental data loss
- Legal/compliance protection
- Easy to add admin recovery tools later
- Audit trail preserved

### User Experience
- Instant deletion from user's view
- Other users unaffected
- Standard iOS messaging behavior
- Works with existing UI (context menu, swipe-to-delete)

### Performance
- Client-side filtering is fast
- No database writes to RTDB for message deletion
- Minimal Firestore writes (one field update)
- RTDB only stores status flags

## Privacy Policy Language

```
Deletion Policy:
- Deleted messages are hidden from your view immediately
- Other participants can still see messages until they delete them
- Deleted content is retained on our servers for legal and safety purposes
- You can request complete data deletion by contacting support
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### If Needed Later
1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Cloud Function to hard-delete messages after all users delete (30-90 day grace period)
2. **Admin Tools**: Dashboard to view/manage deleted content
3. **Bulk Operations**: Delete all messages when hiding conversation
4. **Export**: Allow users to export their data before deletion
5. **AI Integration**: Filter deleted messages from AI features when implemented

### Not Implemented (By Design)
- Hard deletion when all users delete (storage is cheap, safety is expensive)
- Message deletion on conversation hide (adds complexity, users rarely care)
- Automatic cleanup (can add later if storage becomes concern)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can delete their own messages
- [ ] Deleted messages disappear from user's view
- [ ] Deleted messages still visible to other users
- [ ] User can hide conversations
- [ ] Hidden conversations disappear from user's list
- [ ] Hidden conversations still visible to other users
- [ ] New messages in hidden conversation make it reappear
- [ ] Deleted messages stay deleted after app restart
- [ ] Hidden conversations stay hidden after app restart
- [ ] Security rules prevent unauthorized deletion modifications

## Files Modified

1. `swift-send/Models/Models.swift` - Added `deletedFor` and `isHidden` fields
2. `swift-send/Managers/MessagingManager.swift` - New deletion methods and filtering
3. `swift-send/Managers/FirestoreManager.swift` - Read `deletedFor` field
4. `swift-send/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift` - Updated to use new deletion method
5. `swift-send/ViewModels/MainViewModel.swift` - Updated to use new hiding method and filter
6. `firestore.rules` - Allow `deletedFor` updates

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Old messages without `deletedFor` field work fine (treated as not deleted)
- **Existing Conversations**: Work without `isHidden` flag (treated as not hidden)
- **No Data Migration Needed**: System handles missing fields gracefully
- **Deprecated Methods**: Old delete methods marked deprecated but still functional
